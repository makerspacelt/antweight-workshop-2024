# 2024 Antweight robot workshop

Organized at [Kaunas Makerspace](https://makerspace.lt) in October 2024.

DIY Antweight Robot designed for an inexpensive workshop that introduces
soldering & robotics to beginners. It's fun to assemble in a group and then
fight in an arena. The robot follows Lithuanian Antweight format - 200 g weight.

The robot is controlled via a website: https://makerspace.lt/antweight-workshop-2024/

* Open the website using Use Google Chrome or a Chrome-based browser on Android. On iOS use the [Bluefy browser](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluefy-web-ble-browser/id1492822055). The website connects your phone to the robot's ESP32 microcontroller using the [Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API#browser_compatibility).

Total cost of everything (if you source 1 cell lithium battery yourself) - around 15eur.
